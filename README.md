This gem allows you to easily use [Hashids](http://hashids.org/ruby/) in your
Rails app. Instead of your models using sequential numbers like 1, 2, 3, they
will instead have unique short hashes like "yLA6m0oM", "5bAyD0LO", and
"wz3MZ49l". The database will still use integers under the hood, so this gem can
be added or removed at any time.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'hashid-rails'
```

And then execute:

```shell
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```shell
$ gem install hashid-rails
```

## Basic Usage

1. Include Hashid Rails in the ActiveRecord model you'd like to enable hashids.

```ruby
class Model < ActiveRecord::Base
  include Hashid::Rails
end
```

2. Continue using `Model#find` passing in either a hashid or regular 'ol id.

```ruby
@person = Person.find(params[:hashid])
```

## Get hashid of model

You can access the hashid of any model using the `hashid` method.

```ruby
model = Model.find(params[:hashid])
model.hashid
#=> "yLA6m0oM"
```

Additionally, the `to_param` method is overriden to use hashid instead of id.
This means methods that take advantage of implicit ID will automatically work
with hashids.

```erb
Passing a hashid model to `link_to`â€¦
<%= link_to "Model", model %>

will use `hashid` instead of `id`.
<a href="/models/yLA6m0oM">Model</a>
```

## Alternative Usage

You can use the `Model#find_by_hashid` method to find a record without falling
back on the standard `find` method. This can be useful in cases where the hashid
might be misinterpreted by the `find` method, such as using a hashid containing
only numbers that could be both interpreted as either an id and or a hashid.

```ruby
# When a record is found, it returns the record.
@person = Person.find_by_hashid(params[:hashid])

# When no record, is found it raises an exception.
ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound
```

## Configuration

To customize the Hashids seed and ensure that another user of the gem cannot
easily reverse engineer your ids, create an initializer and:

```ruby
Hashid::Rails.configure do |config|
  config.secret = 'my secret'
  config.length = 6
  # config.alphabet is optional, hashids provides a default
  # alphabet that consists of all characters [a-zA-Z0-9]
  config.alphabet = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
  
  # If your alphbet contains any numerals [0-9], then we recommend diabling the find method
  #config.disable_find = true
end
```
### Disable Find Method

If your alphabet includes numerals (0-9) and if the ids in your database are the same length as your hashes, then there could be valid
hashids that are identical to valid ids.  This ambiguity could lead the `find` method to behave unpredictably.  Since `find` accepts both
hashids and ids, an input argument that is potentially both a valid hashid and id, will cause `find` to treat the argument as a hashid
in some cases, and as an id in others.  This unpredictably is usually not desired and can lead to subtle bugs appearing at runtime

In order to avoid this problem, users can add `config.disable_find = true` to their initializer.  This will disable the hashid
functionality of the `find` method and force `find` to only accept normal (unhashed) ids.  Under this configuration, programmer 
will need to use the `find_by_hashid` method when desiring to explicitly search by hashid.

It is recommended that `config.disable_find = true` be set when the alphabet contains any numerals.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run
`bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To
release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run
`bundle exec rake release` to create a git tag for the version, push git commits
and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
